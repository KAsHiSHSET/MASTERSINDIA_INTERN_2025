## In reference to New.js,
PROBLEM :- 
You have a list of IDs (["a", "b", "d"]) stored in Redis

That list is also stored in memory in your code (like a variable)

You want to add new IDs via an API ‚Äî it will go to Redis only

Every 1 minute, your code should sync from Redis to the code's memory using a cron job

### üîÑ Redis-Based ID Cache with Auto-Sync via Cron
This Node.js application manages a list of IDs stored in Redis and automatically syncs it with an in-memory cache in the code every 1 minute using a cron job.

#### ‚ú® Features
üöÄ REST API to add new IDs to Redis (POST /add-id)

üîç Endpoint to fetch in-memory cached IDs (GET /ids)

üîÅ Auto-refreshes in-memory list from Redis every 1 minute via node-cron

üß† In-memory caching improves performance and avoids unnecessary Redis reads

#### üõ† Tech Stack
Node.js

Express

async-redis

node-cron

Redis (as cache DB)

#### üß™ Sample Flow
###### Redis pre-populated with ["a", "b", "d"]

###### New ID ("c") added via API

###### After 1 minute, cron job updates in-memory list to ["a", "b", "d", "c"]
